# GitHub Training Task - Fibonacci Series (Multiple Languages)
       
       Welcome to the GitHub training bootcamp! Your task is to fix a simple Fibonacci program. The repository contains four files in the *main branch*, each corresponding to a different programming language: Python, C, C++, and Java.
       
       ## 📌 Task Description
       Each file contains an incomplete Fibonacci program with missing parts marked as FIXME. Your job is to fix the code, commit your changes, and submit a pull request.
       
       ## 🚀 Steps to Complete the Task
       
       ### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
       First, clone the GitHub repository to your local system.
       sh
       git clone https://github.com/GitStudentHub/Git2Azure-Final-Task.git
       cd training-repo
       
       
       ### 2️⃣ Create a New Branch
       You must create a new branch before making changes. The branch name should be based on the language you are working with.
       sh
       git checkout -b fix-bug-gitstudenthub-python  # For Python
       git checkout -b fix-bug-gitstudenthub-c       # For C
       git checkout -b fix-bug-gitstudenthub-cpp     # For C++
       git checkout -b fix-bug-gitstudenthub-java    # For Java

       
       ### 3️⃣ Fix the Code
       Open the respective file and resolve the FIXME comments by correcting the Fibonacci series implementation.
       
       *Files to Fix:*
       - main.py (Python)
       - main.c (C)
       - main.cpp (C++)
       - Main.java (Java)
       
       ### 4️⃣ Commit Your Changes
       After fixing the code, stage and commit your changes.
       sh
       git add .
       git commit -m "Fixed Fibonacci function in [language]"
       
       
       ### 5️⃣ Push Your Changes
       Push your branch to GitHub.
       ```sh
       git push origin fix-bug-gitstudenthub-[language]

       ### 6️⃣ Create a Pull Request (PR)
       - Go to the *GitHub repository* in your browser.
       - Click on *Compare & pull request*.
       - Add a brief message about your fix.
       - Click *Create pull request*.
       
       ## ✅ Completion Criteria
       - Your PR should contain a correctly working Fibonacci program.
       - The PR should follow the branch naming convention: fix-bug-gitstudenthub-[language].
       - GitHub Actions will check if your code compiles and runs correctly.
       
       ## 🔥 Good Luck!
